Antennas and Propagation

An antenna is an active device conductor or system of conductors :
◼ Transmission - radiates electromagnetic energy into space
◼ Reception - collects electromagnetic energy from space
◼ In two-way communication, the same antenna can be used for transmission and reception

Radiation Patterns : 
◼ Radiation pattern
	◼ Graphical representation of radiation properties of an
	antenna
	◼ Depicted as two-dimensional cross section
◼ Beam width (or half-power beam width)
	◼ Measure of directivity of antenna
◼ Reception pattern
	◼ Receiving antenna’s equivalent to radiation pattern

Types of Antennas :
◼ Isotropic antenna (idealized)
	◼ Radiates power equally in all directions
◼ Dipole antennas
	◼ Half-wave dipole antenna (or Hertz antenna)
	◼ Quarter-wave vertical antenna (or Marconi
	antenna)
◼ Parabolic Reflective Antenna

Antenna Gain : 
◼ Antenna gain
	◼ Power output, in a particular direction,
	compared to that produced in any direction by a
	perfect omnidirectional antenna (isotropic
	antenna)
◼ Effective area
	◼ Related to physical size and shape of antenna

Categories of Noise : 
◼ Thermal Noise
◼ Intermodulation noise
◼ Crosstalk
◼ Impulse Noise

Thermal Noise : 
◼ Thermal noise due to agitation of electrons
◼ Present in all electronic devices and transmission media
◼ Cannot be eliminated
◼ Function of temperature
◼ Particularly significant for satellite communication

Other Impairments : 
◼ Atmospheric absorption – water vapor and oxygen contribute to attenuation
◼ Multipath – obstacles reflect signals so that multiple copies with varying delays are received
◼ Refraction – bending of radio waves as they propagate through the atmosphere

Multipath Propagation : 
◼ Reflection - occurs when signal encounters a surface that is large relative to the wavelength of the signal
◼ Diffraction - occurs at the edge of an impenetrable body that is large compared to wavelength of radio wave
◼ Scattering – occurs when incoming signal hits an object whose size in the order of the wavelength of the signal or less

The Effects of Multipath Propagation : 
◼ Multiple copies of a signal may arrive at different phases
◼ If phases add destructively, the signal level relative to noise declines, making detection more difficult
◼ Intersymbol interference (ISI)
◼ One or more delayed copies of a pulse may arrive at the same time as the primary pulse for a subsequent bit

Types of Fading : 
◼ Fast fading
◼ Slow fading
◼ Flat fading
◼ Selective fading
◼ Rayleigh fading
◼ Rician fading

Diversity Techniques : 
◼ Diversity is based on the fact that individual channels experience independent fading events
◼ Space diversity – techniques involving physical transmission path
◼ Frequency diversity – techniques where the signal is spread out over a larger frequency bandwidth or carried on multiple frequency carriers
◼ Time diversity – techniques aimed at spreading the data out over time
