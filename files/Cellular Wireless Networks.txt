Cellular Network Organization : 
-Use multiple low-power transmitters (100 W or less)
-Areas divided into cells
    Each served by its own antenna
    Served by base station consisting of transmitter, receiver, and control unit
    Band of frequencies allocated
    Cells set up such that antennas of all neighbors are equidistant (hexagonal pattern)

Frequency Reuse : 
-Adjacent cells assigned different frequencies to avoid interference or crosstalk
-Objective is to reuse frequency in nearby cells
    10 to 50 frequencies assigned to each cell,
    Transmission power controlled to limit power at that frequency escaping to adjacent cells,
    The issue is to determine how many cells must intervene between two cells using the same frequency.

Approaches to Cope with Increasing Capacity : 
-Adding new channels
-Frequency borrowing – frequencies are taken from adjacent cells by congested cells
-Cell splitting – cells in areas of high usage can be split into smaller cells
-Cell sectoring – cells are divided into a number of wedge-shaped sectors, each with their own set of channels
-Microcells – antennas move to buildings, hills, and lamp posts

Cellular Systems Terms : 
-Base Station (BS) – includes an antenna, a controller, and a number of receivers
-Mobile telecommunications switching office (MTSO) – connects calls between mobile units
-Two types of channels available between mobile unit and BS
    Control channels “CCH” – used to exchange information having to do with setting up and maintaining calls
    Traffic channels  “TCH”– carry voice or data connection between users

Steps in an MTSO Controlled Call between Mobile Users :
-Mobile unit initialization
-Mobile-originated call
-Paging
-Call accepted
-Ongoing call
-Handoff

Additional Functions in an MTSO Controlled Call : 
-Call blocking (GOS <= 2%)
-Call termination
-Call drop
-Calls to/from fixed and remote mobile subscriber

Mobile Radio Propagation Effects : 
-Signal strength
    Must be strong enough between base station and mobile unit to maintain signal quality at the receiver
    Must not be so strong as to create too much co-channel interference with channels in another cell using the same frequency band
-Fading
    Signal propagation effects may disrupt the signal and cause errors

Handoff Strategies Used to Determine Instant of Handoff : 
-Relative signal strength
-Relative signal strength with threshold
-Relative signal strength with hysteresis
-Relative signal strength with hysteresis and threshold
-Prediction techniques

Traffic Engineering : 
-Ideally, available channels would equal number of subscribers active at one time
-In practice, not feasible to have capacity handle all possible load
-For N simultaneous user capacity and L subscribers
    L < N – nonblocking system
    L > N – blocking system

Blocking System Performance Questions : 
-Probability that call request is blocked?
-What capacity is needed to achieve a certain upper bound on probability of blocking?
-What is the average delay?
-What capacity is needed to achieve a certain average delay?

First-Generation Analog : 
-Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS)
    In North America, two 25-MHz bands allocated to AMPS
        One for transmission from base to mobile unit
        One for transmission from mobile unit to base
-Each band split in two to encourage competition
-Frequency reuse exploited

AMPS Operation : 
-Subscriber initiates call by keying in phone number and presses send key
-MTSO verifies number and authorizes user
-MTSO issues message to user’s cell phone indicating send and receive traffic channels
-MTSO sends ringing signal to called party
-Party answers; MTSO establishes circuit and initiates billing information
-Either party hangs up; MTSO releases circuit, frees channels, completes billing

Differences Between First and Second Generation Systems : 
-Digital traffic channels – first-generation systems are almost purely analog; second-generation systems are digital
-Encryption – all second generation systems provide encryption to prevent eavesdropping
-Error detection and correction – second-generation digital traffic allows for detection and correction, giving clear voice reception
-Channel access – second-generation systems allow channels to be dynamically shared by a number of users

Mobile Station : 
-Mobile station communicates across Um interface (air interface) with base station transceiver in same cell as mobile unit
-Mobile equipment (ME) – physical terminal, such as a telephone or PCS
    ME includes radio transceiver, digital signal processors and subscriber identity module (SIM)
-GSM subscriber units are generic until SIM is inserted
    SIMs roam, not necessarily the subscriber devices

ITU’s View of Third-Generation Capabilities : 
-Voice quality comparable to the public switched telephone network
-144 kbps data rate available to users in high-speed motor vehicles over large areas
-384 kbps available to pedestrians standing or moving slowly over small areas
-Support for 2.048 Mbps for office use
-Symmetrical / asymmetrical data transmission rates
-Support for both packet switched and circuit switched data services
-An adaptive interface to the Internet to reflect efficiently the common asymmetry between inbound and outbound traffic
-More efficient use of the available spectrum in general
-Support for a wide variety of mobile equipment
-Flexibility to allow the introduction of new services and technologies
